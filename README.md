    ADAF - Automatic DMV Appointment Finder!
    Node script based on zombie to automagically find an appointment at the beloved DMV
    
    Apointments at the DMV become available sporadically. I believe this is due to people canceling or not 
    confirming their apointments. Those apointment are really hard to get. This script will periodically check the DMVs specified 
    for appointments up to a certain date. If an apointment is found within the time frame a text-message is sent
    using Twilio.

    This works for the California DMV site at the time of writing (05.04.2017)
